## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first, responsive design

### What I learned

1. For some reason, I hadn't previously understood how `position: absolute` works together with `position: relative`. Now it clicked for me that absolutely positioned elemens aren't always absolutely positioned to `body` element! Nearest relatively positioned element is set up as a parent element for absolutely positioned child in any nested level. Cool!

2. A couple of weeks ago, I learned that [mathematical comparison operators for media queries were shipped out in Chrome 104](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/new-in-chrome-104/#mq-math). I wanted to test them out in this project for the first time. In my opinion, they feel a loot nicer to use than i.e. `max-width` and `min-width`! I'll use them in future projects as well.

```css
@media (width > 576px) {
    body {
        padding: 32px;
    }
}
```

3. Usually I like to use SCSS but for this project I just went with plain CSS. I noticed pretty soon how much I miss the nested syntax of SCSS. It makes reading style hierarchies SO much better. Not going to make the same mistake again dropping it. ðŸ˜œ

4. How to import Google Fonts with `@import`!

### Continued development

I want to make responsive design bread-and-butter for me. Need to work on that, absolutely.

### Useful resources

- [Box-shadow generator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Backgrounds_and_Borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This helped me to visually understand `box-shadow`. A really cool tool!
